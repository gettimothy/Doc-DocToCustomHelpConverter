again.A convert to-from github markdown is a dim-idea at the moment.<a id="org6316d2c"></a>## Todo    make both converters work properly to 7 levels.    Headlines should automatically reflect a subclass or page     subclasses as pages should not be included twice    grok the infinite recursion on some Help topics.<a id="orgf8947d0"></a>## Installation        This project

CustomHelp subclass was created by evaluating:             DocOrgToCustomHelpConverter createFromFileChooser.                DocOrgToX is a set of Squeak Doc classes used to convert between CustomHelp to Markup and back again.        The DocCustomHelpToOrgConveter and DocOrgToCustomHelpConverter classes convert from CustomHelp to Org and back again.

to at most three levels of org headline.    They are of fomr                * Book Name  [ClassNameOfHelp]         ** Page name  [optionalshortpagenamehere]        ** One  [pageone]   "this page

Squeak from an Org file    DocOrgToCustomHelp createFromFileChooser.<a id="org8b02fce"></a>## Org Markup       https://orgmode.org/guide/                            For Squeak Help, the author chose to utilize only Org headlines         https://orgmode.org/guide/Headlines.html#Headlines                                 and the Begin Example End Example Block for escaping wierd stuff that is difficult to parse like  &^#^&@*(%                and for escaping the                BEGIN_EXAMPLE/END_EXAMPLE Block itself (down to one level)                Two Squeak specific additions have been added to delineate method names and class names for CustomHelp methods/pages and subclasses.            These are used in headlines to specify either a page selector or a subclass of a topic.        heaqdlines with lower case names, one word in brackets [likethis] specify a page selector    headlines with no brackets default to the equivalent of this [headlineswithnobracketsdefaulttotheequivalentofthis]    headlines upper case names, one word in Brackets and ending in Help [LikeThisHelp] specify a subclass (sub-book) to create.<a id="org81ddb07"></a>## Why                The author uses Emacs and Org mode and is trying to improve the documentation for Squeak.        There is boatloads of information on Squeak out there, it is just very hard to find sometimes.        This tool (and others to follow) will attempt to make it easy to create and maintain content without the bother of working with the CustomHelp classes directly.
